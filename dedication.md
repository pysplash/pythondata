# Dedication

**For Pythonistas Around the Globe:**

You have inspired and encouraged me. I hope that I have in some small way helped you along in your Python journey.

Programming languages are designed for people and their productivity. Here's to many more years of Python and its community solving global and local issues. 

*Believe the impossible is possible.*

**For Steve, Linnea, and Jake:**

Your love and acceptance are precious gifts. 

I cherish you. Thanks for inspiring me.
