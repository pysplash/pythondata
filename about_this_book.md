# About This Book

This book approaches learning skills in Python and data science in a way similar
to how a musician learns to play a new instrument or gain more experience.
The goal will be to structure each "practice" session in a way that helps
you build skills over time.

- Tools | Instrument - Understanding and familiarity
- Technique - Improve or fine tune an aspect
- Notebook (new) | song or piece of music (new)
- Notebook (old favorites) | repertoire
- Self | musician - effective practice and goals

Start where you are. You bring background and understanding which is valuable.
Think of the problems you solve in the course of your day. Many of the same
skills that you use to solve day-to-day problems will also be the skills you
will use in data exploration and coding.


## Structure

Prepare, plan and act for success

1. Goal for today's session
2. Get warmed up (Work through a compelling example notebook ideally related to the real world)
3. Tool check: Learn a new thing about git, editor
4. New notebook around a concept
5. Review some old favorite notebooks
6. Goals until the next session
