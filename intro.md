Python Data Explorations
========================

A book for learning how data, knowledge, action, and Python
converge in our world.

This book takes inspiration from my efforts to learn to play guitar and ukulele.
The process of practice and incremental steps that I went through to learn
guitar parallels the process of learning and applying a programming language.
